      <h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
      <p>
        I have had a few internships at this point. I had an internship back in highschool where I was a web
      developer. Back then I really did not know very much about programming or web developement at all, but
      it was a really good learning experience. I learned about http requests, databases, git and source code, and many
      other things. I ended up going back there after my first year at RIT and learned much more about how a company operates,
      how to work with clients, both large companies and small businesses.</p>
      <p>
        I had so much fun learning about so many new things and
      it motivated me to branch out. My last co-op was with the Air Force Research Lab, where I studied and solved problems
      for quantum computing. I learned about the cutting edge of computers and where quantum is taking us. You asked why I want to
      be a software engineer? I want to learn! I want to discover! I want to create! I am just hoping for the chance to learn more from you.</p>
